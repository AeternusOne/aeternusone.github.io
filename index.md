# Zoe Michael Katchy  - Offensive Security Portfolio

Welcom to my professional penetration testing portfolio.
I specialize in:

- External Attack Surface Mapping
- CIDR Reconnaissance & Infrastructure Testing

- Vulnerability Research & Bug Bounty Recon

Below are redacted case studies from legal security testing engagements
and bug bounty programs with explicitly in-scope targets.

## About Me

I am an offensive security practitioner with a practical, methodical approach to testing. I focus on real-world
attack surfaces - CIDR recon, infrastructure assessment, and web/API exploitation - and I prioritize depth,
clarity and structure in how I work.

Most of my growth comes from hands-on practice: mapping large IP ranges in in-scope bug bounty programs, 
breaking down complex systems through disciplined enumeration, and studyinh applications until their logic becomes
clear. I like building reliable workflows, improving my methodology, and documenting my findings in a way that reflects
how I think: direct, structured, and grounded in evidence.

I'm ambitious about my craft but careful about the process. My goal is continuous improvement - sharpening my offensive
capabalities one engagement, one writeup, and one skill at a time.
